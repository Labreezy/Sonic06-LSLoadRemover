# Sonic '06 LivesSplit Console Load Remover (Unofficial)

##Prerequisites

The VideoAutoSplit livesplit component, extract to your "Components" folder within livesplit
https://github.com/ROMaster2/LiveSplit.VideoAutoSplit/releases/tag/0.5.2.3

##Installation

Restart livesplit after installing the VideoAutoSplit Component.  Right click livepslit -> edit layout, then add a video autosplitter to your layout as shown below.

After that, choose the .vas file you can grab from the "release" tab, as well as your capture card from the capture device list. To test if the component is picking up footage, hit the "Scan Region" tab at the top.  It should show you a preview of whatever capture device you're using.  Hit "reset" if you see footage so that the entire game is covered by the large rectangle.  If the game only occupies a portion of the source, you can drag a rectangle over the game footage within your source.

Make sure you set your comparison to "game time" before testing.  

Sadly, it's not quite possible for everyone to run this and stream due to how resource-intensive this can be, but it should work for most people.
